# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will **churn** (stop using a service) based on historical customer data.  
It uses **machine learning models** to identify high-risk customers so that retention strategies can be implemented.

## ✨ Features
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering.
- Model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
- Visualizations for churn distribution and feature importance.
